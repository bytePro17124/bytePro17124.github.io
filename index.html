  <h4>Quick Bio</h4>
  <p>I grew up in Ohio, spending a lot of time outdoors, exploring the wilderness, and helping out on our farmland. At an early
    age (around 5) my brother and I became interested in electronics and mechanical things. Naturally for two boys this meant
    taking apart nearly every toy we owned once its initial novelty wore off. It was this exploration (and my parents ability
    to put up with and even support it) that allowed me to build up my ability to problemsolve creatively.
  </p>
  <p>During my school years, I developed somewhat of passion for math and the sciences. I also discovered I have competing interests
    and it was very difficult for me to settle on a singular one to pursue for long. When it came time to choose a degree
    for college, I considered at first Engineering, then Computer Science, then Geology, then Psychology, and even Drama.
    I spent two years at DeVry University. I went from Electrical Engineering to Computer Science. Some of the coursework
    proved useful, but mostly I felt as though I was wasting my time and money. I couldn't shake the feeling and soon dropped
    out.
  </p>
  <p>Having doubts about my path of study, I wanted to take time to really figure out what I want to do. I joined the 9-5 workforce,
    building my resume up as an IT Technician. IT was a group I was lumped into since most knew me as the guy who liked and
    could fix computers. I couldn't complain as it was more cushy than most careers. Fixing computer and dealing with IT
    problems wore on me. I began to see trends in the problems. Some of these systems where obnoxious design flaws such as
    laptops built by engineers that don't understand thermodynamics (I'm looking at you sub-2012 Hewlett Packard). Other
    times it was incomplete systems, or those seemingly designed to be difficult to use. Broken stuff and accidents I could
    understand, but software design flaws really hit a nerve. I began to feel I could make some positive impact on making
    it better if I tried...but where do I start? And what would really motivate me to actually do it?</p>
  <p>I couldn't deny that I wanted to write stories and be creative too. I played guitar in a few bands, wrote short stories,
    played Dungeons and Dragons as a Dungeon Master, was addicted to World of Warcraft for a while, and was known in my hometown
    as the prodigy Magic: The Gathering player (because kept winning the local tournaments and could recite practically every
    magic card in existance at the time). I was good at strategy, problemsovling, being creative, and persistant.</p>
  <p>One day while working for Ohio University at a Service Desk, it clicked. Computer Science is my next step. I need to dive
    deep here. Both on my own and at Ohio University as an Undergrad in 2014, I began to study Computer Science by educated
    choice. I will be graduating with a bachelor's degree in CS in December, 2018. My goal is to use this knowledge and training
    to assist my intrests, improve technologies, and maybe one day finish a video game of my own creation and tell some unique
    stories.
  </p>
  <p>So what am I doing now? As of Summer 2018, I am in Athens, Ohio volunteering my time at Hua Labs working on a Genetic Algorithm
    focused on finding new undiscovered genes(its more complicated than that but its too much to explain here). In my free
    time I focus on family, advancing my knowledge, programming, and making YouTube videos.</p>
  <p>What's next for me? This upcoming Fall, 2018 I will be studying full time at Ohio University. This will be my last semester
    before graduating. After that, well I'm not too sure yet but I will certainly be building software.</p>
  <p>This is certainly a 'short bio' and of course I've left out tons of things about me (ooo the mystery).</p>
