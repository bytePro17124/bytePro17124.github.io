    <h1>My Biography, in short.</h1>
    <h4>The Early Years.</h4>
    <p>
      I grew up in Ohio, spending a lot of time outdoors, exploring the wilderness, and helping out on our farmland. At
      an
      early age (around 5 or so) my brother and I became increasingly interested in electronics and mechanical things.
      Naturally
      for two boys, this meant taking apart nearly every toy we owned or acquired, just to see how it worked.
    </p>
    <h4>Schooling.</h4>
    <p>
      During my younger school years, I developed somewhat of passion for math and the sciences. I discovered I had many
      interests. Right out of high school, I spent two years at DeVry University studying Electrical Engineering &
      Computer
      Science and later 4 years at Ohio University where I graduated with a B.S.C.S. in Computer Science.
    </p>
    <h4>Professional Work.</h4>
    <p>
      During most of my 20's, I mostly worked at IT and Support companies, dabbling in many varying aspects of computing
      and
      technologies, primarily focusing on hardware break/fixes, upgrades, tear downs, rebuilds, setups, focusing on how
      to optimize load outs for functionality. And sometimes retail to help make ends meet.
      <br>
      Companies included: Best Buy Geek Squad, GNC Computers, Staples EZ Tech, The Laptop Guy, Kroger, Meijer Photo Lab,
      Nutro Products,
      Radio Shack, NiSource, Mt Carmel East
      Hospital, OPERS, Ohio University OIT.
    </p>
    <p>
    In my 30's I began getting more heavily into Computer Science and Programming, finding work in research and
    software
    development, mainly studying the C++ language along with its capabilities and uses.
    <br>Companies Included: Ohio University Hua Labs, Matrix Research
    </p>
    <p>
      After Matrix Research, the dreaded 2020 pandemic hit, and I decided I would make my own company instead of finding
      another position.
    </p>
    <h4>Current & Future.</h4>
    <p>
      Currently I am running my own company, creating media, doing research in C++ software design and development,
      primarily focused on
      computer graphics and running simulated environments (which is a clever way of saying I'm working on a Game Engine
      that encompasses
      spacial 3d rendering, skeletal animations, sound, physix, post processing effects, and more).
