    <h4>The Early Years.</h4>
    <p>
      I grew up in Ohio, spending a lot of time outdoors, exploring the wilderness, and helping out on our farmland. At
      an
      early age (around 5 or so) my brother and I became increasingly interested in electronics and mechanical things.
      Naturally
      for two boys, this meant taking apart nearly every toy we owned or acquired, just to see how it worked.
    </p>
    <h4>Schooling.</h4>
    <p>
      During my younger school years, I developed somewhat of passion for math and the sciences. I discovered I had many
      interests. Right out of high school, I spent two years at DeVry University studying Electrical Engineering &
      Computer
      Science and later 4 years at Ohio University where I graduated with a B.S.C.S. in Computer Science.
    </p>
    <h4>Professional Work.</h4>
    <p>
      During most of my 20's, I worked at IT and Support companies, dabbling in many varying aspects of computing and
      technologies, primarily focusing on hardware break/fixes, upgrades, tear downs, rebuilds, setups, focusing on how
      to optimize load outs for functionality.
      <br>
      Companies included: Best Buy Geek Squad, GNC Computers, Staples EZ Tech, The Laptop Guy, NiSource, Mt Carmel East
      Hospital, OPERS, Ohio University OIT.
    </p>
    <p>
      And sometimes retail to help make ends meet.
      <br>Companies include: Kroger, Nutro Products, Radio Shack.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also did odd jobs, taking on helping friends and family with any various computer stuff they needed, usually
      ordering and putting
      in new parts, recommendations for software, best practices, and the like.</p>

    <p>
      In my 30's I began getting more heavily into Computer Science and Programming, finding work in research and
      software
      development, mainly studying the C++ language along with its capabilities and uses.
      <br>Companies Included: Ohio University Hua Labs, Matrix Research
    </p>
    <p>
      After Matrix Research, the dreaded 2020 pandemic hit, and I decided I would make my own company instead of finding
      another position.
    </p>
    <h4>Current & Future.</h4>
    <p>
      Currently I am running my own company, creating media, doing research in C++ software design and development,
      primarily focused on
      computer graphics and running simulated environments (which is a clever way of saying I'm working on a Game Engine
      that encompasses
      spacial 3d rendering, skeletal animations, sound, physix, post processing effects, and more).
