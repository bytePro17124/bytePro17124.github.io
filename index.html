    <em>coder, father, computer scientist, creator, jack-of-all-trades</em>
  </p>
  <h4>Quick Bio</h4>
  <p>I grew up in Ohio, spending a lot of time outdoors and exploring the wilderness and just as much time getting into video
    games, computers, and electronics.</p>
  <p>During my grade school years, I developed somewhat of passion for math and the sciences and also discovered I really like
    strategy games and writing stories. Most people know me as a jack of all trades as I have many varying hobbies and can
    be rather obsessive about becoming extremely good at them. More recently I've begun making various YouTube videos and
    trying out my hand at producing watchable videos - I have a gaming channel, a coding and tech channel, a personal channel,
    and a reading kids books channel. I guess its worth mentioning that I love playing guitar and writing songs too, however
    I gave up on the dream of anything panning out from that years ago and have since moved on (my ego couldn't take anymore),
    but I still play guitar almost daily because I just enjoy it.</p>
  <p>These days I study Computer Science both on my own and at Ohio University. I will be graduating with a bachelor's degree
    in CS in December, 2018. My goal is to use this knowledge and training to assist my intrests, and maybe one day finish
    a video game of my own creation and tell a new story.</p>
  <p>Summer 2018 - I am in Athens, Ohio working at Hua Labs on a Genetic Algorithm focus on finding new undiscovered genes.
    In my free time I'm spending time with my family and advancing my knowledge on any subject I find interesting, which
    happen to be (aside from Genetics) Programming Game Design Patterns and Pyshcology.</p>
  <p>Fall 2018 - I will be a Full Time Computer Science Student at Ohio University. This will be my last semester before graduating.</p>
  <p>2019 - TBA</p>
