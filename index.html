    <em>engineer, programmer, computer scientist, creator, father</em>
  </p>
  <h4>Quick Bio</h4>
  <p>I grew up in Ohio, spending a lot of time outdoors, exploring the wilderness, and helping out on our farmland. At an early
    age (around 5) my brother and I became interested in electronics and mechanics, taking apart nearly everything we owned,
    tinkering for days on end. It was all for fun at the time, but I think it was this that really began to define me as
    a budding engineer and build up my ability to problemsolve creatively. This was supported and influenced by our father
    who was always fixing something on the farm (or a car) and had a degree in agriculture engineering from Ohio State University.
  </p>
  <p>During my school years, I developed somewhat of passion for math and the sciences. I also discovered I have competing interests
    and it was very difficult for me to settle on a singular one to pursue during college. I considered at first Engineering,
    then Computer Science, then Geology, then Psychology, and even Drama. I couldn't decide. I found I could study most of
    these on my own, and dropped out of college after incuring some serious debt. Having doubts about my path of study, I
    wanted to take time to really figure out what I want to do. I joined the 9-5 workforce, building my resume up as an IT
    Technician. It was a group I was lumped into since most knew me as the guy who could fix computers and I couldn't complain
    as it was better than most careers. However I wasn't satisfied fixing computers and networks and dealing with IT problems.
    It became apparent to me that some of these systems had obnoxious design flaws that made everything way harder than it
    needed to be. I began to feel I could make some positive impact on making it better if I tried...but where do I start?
    And what would really motivate me to actually do it?</p>
  <p>I couldn't deny that I wanted to write stories and be creative too. I played guitar in a few bands, wrote short stories,
    played Dungeons and Dragons as a Dungeon Master, was addicted to World of Warcraft for a while, and was known in my hometown
    as the prodigy Magic: The Gathering player (I kept winning the local tournaments). I was good at strategy, problemsovling,
    and being creative. Eventually that became clear to me. I don't know why I doubted myself for so long, maybe due to the
    inability to handle toxic relationships properly? I was too agreeable I think (this probably came from my mother, who
    is known to many as the nicest person in the world). Well fuck you old toxic 'friends', I'm not all that agreeable anymore,
    and my respect is only given if earned. I've got real important things that matter to deal with now. I need to go out
    there and make the difference I feel I might actually be able to make. One day while working for Ohio University at a
    Service Desk, it clicked. Computer Science is my next step. I need to dive deep here. Both on my own and at Ohio University
    as an Undergrad in 2014, I began to study Computer Science in full force. I will be graduating with a bachelor's degree
    in CS in December, 2018. My goal is to use this knowledge and training to assist my intrests, improve technologies, and
    maybe one day finish a video game of my own creation and tell some unique stories.
  </p>
  <p>So what am I doing now? As of Summer 2018, I am in Athens, Ohio volunteering my time at Hua Labs working on a Genetic Algorithm
    focused on finding new undiscovered genes(its more complicated than that but its too much to explain here). In my free
    time I focus on family, advancing my knowledge, programming, and making YouTube videos.</p>
  <p>What's next for me? This upcoming Fall, 2018 I will be studying full time at Ohio University. This will be my last semester
    before graduating. After that, well I'm not too sure yet. I may start my own business, or continue research at the lab,
    or join a software development company, or go to grad school. I plan on exploring my options and deciding soon!</p>
  <p>Rest assured, this is certainly a 'short bio' and of course I've left out tons of things about me (ooo the mystery).</p>
