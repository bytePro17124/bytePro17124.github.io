  <h4>Quick Bio</h4>
  <p>I grew up in Ohio, spending a lot of time outdoors, exploring the wilderness, and helping out on our farmland. At an early
    age (around 5 or so) my brother and I became increasingly interested in electronics and mechanical things. Naturally
    for two boys, this meant taking apart nearly every toy we owned once its initial novelty wore off. It was this exploration
    (and my parent's ability to put up with and even support it) that helped me to build up my ability to problemsolve creatively.
  </p>
  <p>During my school years, I developed somewhat of passion for math and the sciences. I discovered I have many interests and
    it was very difficult for me to settle on a singular one to pursue for long. When it came time to choose a degree for
    college, I considered at first Engineering, then Computer Science, then Geology, then Psychology, and even Drama. I was
    interested in a lot of different things! I spent two years at DeVry University. I went from Electrical Engineering to
    Computer Science. I generally enjoyed my time there and made some good friends, but it just didn't seem like the right
    path for me at the time. Some of the coursework proved useful, but mostly I felt as though I was wasting my time and
    money. I couldn't shake the feeling and soon dropped out to join the 9-5 workforce and pursue other interests. 2004-2005
    was probably the most stressful time in my life as I recall my daughter being born and the relationship between her mother
    and I not quite working out as well as we had both imagined previously when we were naive teenagers.
  </p>
  <p>I began building up my resume up as an IT Technician, taking any computer job I could get at first. IT was a group I was
    lumped into since most knew me as the guy who liked and could fix computers. I couldn't complain as it was more cushy
    than most careers. Fixing computer and dealing with IT problems wore on me as I began to see trends in the problems.
    Some of these problems where simply design flaws such as laptops built by engineers that didn't properly take thermodynamics
    into account (I'm looking at you sub-2012 Hewlett Packard). Software design flaws and basic engineering concept fails
    really hit a nerve. I felt like just fixing the same problem from the same companies over and over wasn't really helping
    the core problem in the long run. It was nice to help people out and doing so helped me hone my skills designing engineering
    solutions from many different perspectives. I began to feel I could make some positive impact on these technologies if
    I tried, if I could get my foot in the door somewhere I could use this knowledge... but where do I start? And what would
    really motivate me to actually do it? Should I join a reputable company or start my own?</p>
  <p>I couldn't deny that I wanted to write stories and be creative too. I played guitar in a few bands, wrote countless songs,
    wrote short stories, played Dungeons and Dragons as a Dungeon Master, was addicted to World of Warcraft (end game raider
    ftw) for a while, and was known in my hometown as the prodigy Magic: The Gathering player (because I kept winning the
    local tournaments and could recite practically every magic card in existence at the time). I was good at strategy, problemsovling,
    being creative, and persistent at overcoming obstacles once I had a goal in mind. I was also decent at leading, inspiring,
    criticizing productively, and putting in the work.</p>
  <p>One day while working for Ohio University at a Service Desk, it clicked. Computer Science is my next step. I need to dive
    deep here. Both on my own and at Ohio University as an Undergrad in 2014, I began to study Computer Science and Software
    Design and Development. I will be graduating with a bachelor's degree in CS in December, 2018. My goal is to use this
    knowledge and training to assist my intrests, improve technologies, and maybe one day finish a video game of my own creation
    and tell some unique stories.
  </p>
  <p>So what am I doing now? As of Summer 2018, I am in Athens, Ohio spending my time at Hua Labs working on a Genetic Algorithm
    focused on finding new undiscovered genes(its more complicated than that but its too much to explain here). In my free
    time I focus on family, advancing my knowledge, programming, and making YouTube videos.</p>
  <p>What's next for me? This upcoming Fall, 2018 I will be studying full time at Ohio University. This will be my last semester
    before graduating. After that, well I'm not too sure yet but I will certainly be building software.</p>
  <p>This is certainly a 'short bio' and of course I've left out tons of things about me (ooo the mystery).</p>
