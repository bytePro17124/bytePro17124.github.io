  <title>My Bio</title>
</head>

<p>
  Things I love: <em>music, good food, coffee, science, computers, games, knowledge, math</em>
</p>

<h4>The Early Years.</h4>
<p>
  I grew up in Ohio, spending a lot of time outdoors, exploring the wilderness, and helping out on our farmland. At an
  early age (around 5 or so) my brother and I became increasingly interested in electronics and mechanical things. Naturally
  for two boys, this meant taking apart nearly every toy we owned or acquired, just to see how it worked.
</p>
<h4>Schooling.</h4>
<p>
  During my younger school years, I developed somewhat of passion for math and the sciences. I discovered I had many
  interests. Right out of high school, I spent two years at DeVry University studying Electrical Engineering & Computer 
  Science and 4 years at Ohio University where I graduated with a B.S.C.S. in Computer Science, a 4 year bachelor degree.
</p>
<h4>Professional Work.</h4>
<p>
  During most of my 20's, I worked at IT companies, dabbling in all aspects of computing and technologies. In my 30's I 
  began getting more heavily into Computer Science and Programming, and began work in research and software development
  companies, mainly studying the C++ langauge along with its capabilities and uses.
