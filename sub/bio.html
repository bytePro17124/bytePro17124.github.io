<h3>Quick Bio</h3>
<p>I grew up in Ohio, spending a lot of time outdoors, exploring the wilderness, and helping out on our farmland. At an
  early
  age (around 5 or so) my brother and I became increasingly interested in electronics and mechanical things. Naturally
  for two boys, this meant taking apart nearly every toy we owned once its initial novelty wore off. It was this
  exploration (and my parent's ability to put up with and even support it) that helped me to build up my ability to
  problemsolve creatively.
</p>
<p>During my school years, I developed somewhat of passion for math and the sciences. I discovered I have many
  interests and
  it was very difficult for me to settle on a singular one to pursue for long. When it came time to choose a degree for
  college, I considered at first Engineering, then Computer Science, then Geology, then Psychology, and even Drama. I
  was interested (and at least semi-talented) in, a lot of different things! I spent two years at DeVry University
  studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science. I generally enjoyed my time there and made some good friends, but
  it just
  didn't seem like the right path for me at the time. I dropped out to join the 9-5 workforce and pursue other
  interests. 2004-2005
  was probably the most stressful time in my life as I recall my daughter being born and the relationship between her
  mother and I not quite working out as well as we had both imagined previously when we were naive teenagers.
</p>
<p>I began building up my resume up as an IT Technician, taking any computer job I could get at first. IT was a group I
  was lumped into since most knew me as the guy who liked and could fix computers. I couldn't complain as it was more
  cushy
  than most careers. Fixing computer and dealing with IT problems wore on me as I began to see trends in the problems.
  Some of these problems where simply design flaws such as laptops built by engineers that didn't properly take
  thermodynamics into account (I'm looking at you sub-2012 Hewlett Packard). Software design flaws and basic
  engineering concept fails
  really hit a nerve. I felt like just fixing the same problem from the same companies over and over wasn't really
  helping
  the core problem in the long run. It was nice to help people out and doing so helped me hone my skills designing
  engineering
  solutions from many different perspectives. I began to feel I could make some positive impact on these technologies
  if
  I tried, if I could get my foot in the door somewhere I could use this knowledge... but where do I start? And what
  would
  really motivate me to actually do it? Should I join a reputable company or start my own?</p>
<p>I couldn't deny that I wanted to write stories and be creative too. I played guitar in a few bands, wrote countless
  songs,
  wrote short stories, played Dungeons and Dragons as a Dungeon Master, was addicted to World of Warcraft (end game
  raider
  ftw) for a while, and was known in my hometown as the prodigy Magic: The Gathering player (because I kept winning the
  local tournaments and could recite practically every magic card in existence at the time). I was good at strategy,
  problemsovling,
  being creative, and persistent at overcoming obstacles once I had a goal in mind. I was also decent at leading,
  inspiring,
  criticizing productively, and putting in the work. What should I do? I stay programming, working on a game engine and
  building
  software. Need me for something else? Hire me!</p>
<p>One day while working for Ohio University at a Service Desk, it clicked. Computer Science is my next step. I need to
  dive
  deep here. Both on my own and at Ohio University as an Undergrad in 2014, I began to study Computer Science and
  Software
  Design and Development. I will be graduating with a bachelor's degree in CS in December, 2018. My goal is to use this
  knowledge and training to assist my intrests, improve technologies, and maybe one day finish a video game of my own
  creation and tell some unique stories in the process.
